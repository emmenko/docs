### Unique

Dark isn't just a language. It's a combination of the language, editor, framework, and infrastructure. When writing code in Dark, you can run functions, and wait to handle errors. Many aspects that would be not considered "language" in other environments are part of Dark.

Dark also includes HTTP libraries for interacting with external APIs, a package manager to make that even easier, and built in functionality for datastores.

### Functional

Dark is a statically-typed functional/imperative hybrid, based loosely on ML. Dark has implicit returns, and makes heavy use of pipelines and functions like `List::map`

### More Details
Dark is somewhat similar to OCaml or Elm. It has many similarities to Rust and Haskell, and is also influenced by Clojure, Ruby, Python, Coffeescript, as well as our experience with (alphabetically) Bash, C, Clojure, Coffeescript, C++, Elm, Javascript, Java, Haskell, OCaml, Perl, PHP, Python, ReasonML, Ruby/Rails, React, and Rust.
